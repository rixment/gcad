# gcad 3d toolkit
This is an old code of mine written in C++ (C99) while being a student. This project introduced me to the semantics and syntax of the language. It also helped me to get the overall gist of programming paradigms and its best practices. 

Because many years have gone by, I don't know if it will work or even compile as I'm not sure how much of it survived the ravages of time, being copied and shuffled from one CD to another. Moreover I don't remember in what state the project was in when it was abandoned (finding my first job).

It is still a piece of code that I'm proud of and I'm really happy that after so many years it can finally rest in... github
